## Abstract

Data-driven saliency has recently gained a lot of attention thanks to the use of Convolutional Neural Networks for predicting gaze fixations. In this paper we go beyond standard approaches to saliency prediction, in which gaze maps are computed with a feed-forward network, and we present a novel model which can predict accurate saliency maps by incorporating neural attentive mechanisms. The core of our solution is a Convolutional LSTM that focuses on the most salient regions of the input image to iteratively refine the predicted saliency map. Additionally, to tackle the center bias present in human eye fixations, our model can learn a set of prior maps generated with Gaussian functions. We show, through an extensive evaluation, that the proposed architecture overcomes the current state of the art on two public saliency prediction datasets. We further study the contribution of each key components to demonstrate their robustness on different scenarios.

## Requirements
* [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) 0.9.0
* [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) 1.1.0, configured for using Theano as backend 
* OpenCV 3.0.0

Note: Be sure to have ```"image_dim_ordering": "th"``` and ```"backend": "theano"``` in your keras.json file.

## Usage
We built two different versions of our model: one based on the VGG-16 (**SAM-VGG**) and the other based on the ResNet-50 (**SAM-ResNet**). It is possible use both versions of SAM by changing the ```version``` variable in the [config.py](config.py) file (set ```version = 0``` for SAM-VGG or ```version = 1``` for SAM-ResNet).

To compute saliency maps using our pre-trained model:
```
python main.py test path/to/images/folder/
```
where ```"path/to/images/folder/"``` is the path of a folder containing the images for which you want to calculate the saliency maps.

To train our model from scratch:
```
python main.py train
```
It is also necessary to set parameters and paths in the [config.py](config.py) file.

Note: To train our model, both binary fixation maps and groundtruth density maps are required. The current code for loading binary fixation maps supports the format used in SALICON (.mat files). If you want to train our model with other datasets, be sure to appropriately change the loading functions.

## Precomputed Saliency Maps
We provide saliency maps predicted by SAM-VGG and SAM-ResNet for three standard datasets (SALICON, MIT1003 and CAT2000):
* **[SAM-VGG predictions](https://github.com/marcellacornia/sam/releases/download/1.0/sam-vgg_predictions.zip)**
* **[SAM-ResNet predictions](https://github.com/marcellacornia/sam/releases/download/1.0/sam-resnet_predictions.zip)**

In addition, we provide saliency maps predicted by SAM-ResNet on the new release of the SALICON dataset:
* **[SAM-ResNet predictions (SALICON 2017)](https://github.com/marcellacornia/sam/releases/download/1.0/sam-resnet_predictions_salicon2017.zip)**
